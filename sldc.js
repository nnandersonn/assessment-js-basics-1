// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Understand what is required by involved parties and end users"
const design = "Create an overall picture of how different pieces of the software will interact with eachother"
const implementation = "This is writting the necessary code to create a functioning piece of software"
const testingAndIntegration = "Software must be tested to ensure proper functionality and capacity to handle the needed tasks"
const maintain = "Software must be continually updated and maintained to ensure bugs are fixed and it continues to stay relevent with new technology"
